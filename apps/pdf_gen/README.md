## Building

Pre-Requisite: Elixir installed

3. Not proper, but use `iex -S mix` to run it

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
